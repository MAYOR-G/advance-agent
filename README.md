# &#129302; Advance Agent: Your AI-Powered Developer Tools Research Assistant\n\n![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.11+-blue.svg)\n[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\nAn advanced, AI-powered command-line research agent that automates the process of finding and analyzing developer tools. Simply provide a query, and the agent will search for relevant companies, scrape their websites, and provide a detailed analysis and recommendation.\n\n## &#128640; Features\n\n*   **&#128269; Intelligent Search:** Utilizes Google\'s Gemini API to find the most relevant developer tool companies based on your query.\n*   **&#128214; Automated Web Scraping:** Uses Firecrawl to scrape the content of company websites for in-depth analysis.\n*   **&#129504; In-depth Analysis:** Leverages the power of LangGraph and Gemini to create a multi-step analysis workflow, extracting key information like tech stack, pricing, and integrations.\n*   **&#128172; Actionable Recommendations:** Provides a final summary and recommendation to help you choose the best tool for your needs.\n*   **&#128221; Extensible Workflow:** Built with LangGraph, the agent\'s workflow can be easily extended and customized.\n\n## &#129513; How It Works\n\nThe Advance Agent uses a three-step workflow orchestrated by LangGraph:\n\n1.  **Search:** The agent takes your query and uses the Gemini API to find a list of relevant developer tool companies and their websites.\n2.  **Scrape:** For each company found, the agent uses Firecrawl to scrape the content of their official website.\n3.  **Analyze:** The scraped content is then analyzed by the Gemini API to extract key information. A final analysis and recommendation are generated based on all the gathered data.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Start] --> B{User Query};\n    B --> C[Search for Companies];\n    C --> D[Scrape Websites];\n    D --> E[Analyze Content];\n    E --> F[Generate Recommendation];\n    F --> G[End];\n```\n\n## &#128736;&#65039; Technologies Used\n\n*   **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**\n*   **[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) & [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/)**\n*   **[Google Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/)**\n*   **[Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/)**\n*   **[Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)**\n\n## &#128229; Setup and Installation\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/your-username/advance-agent.git\n    cd advance-agent\n    ```\n\n2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**\n    ```bash\n    python -m venv .venv\n    .venv\\Scripts\\activate  # On Windows\n    # source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux\n    ```\n\n3.  **Install the dependencies:**\n    ```bash\n    pip install -r requirements.txt # Assuming you have a requirements.txt, if not, create one from pyproject.toml\n    ```\n\n4.  **Create a `.env` file:**\n    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project and add your API keys:\n    ```\n    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key\n    FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-firecrawl-api-key\n    ```\n    *   Get your Google API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n    *   Get your Firecrawl API key from [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/).\n\n## &#128187; Usage\n\nRun the agent from the command line:\n\n```bash\npython main.py\n```\n\nThe agent will then prompt you for a query. Enter your query and press Enter to start the research process.\n\n**Example Query:**\n\n```\n\🔍 Developer Tools Query --->>: open source logging and monitoring tools\n```\n\nThe agent will then provide a detailed report on the companies it finds.\n\n## &#128211; Project Structure\n\n```\nadvance-agent/\n├── src/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── nodes.py       # Defines the nodes in the LangGraph workflow\n│   ├── state.py       # Defines the application state\n│   └── workflow.py    # Defines the LangGraph workflow\n├── .env               # API keys and environment variables\n├── .gitignore\n├── main.py            # Main entry point for the application\n├── pyproject.toml     # Project metadata and dependencies\n├── README.md\n└── ...\n```\n\n## &#128101; Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!
